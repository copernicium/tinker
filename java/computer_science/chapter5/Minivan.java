	"A minivan has two sliding doors. Each door can be opened by
	either a dashboard switch, its inside handle, or its outside
	handle. However, the inside handles do not work if a child
	lock switch is activated. In order for the sliding doors to open,
	the gear shift must be in park, and the master unlock switch
	 must be activated. (This book’s author is the long­suffering
	owner of just such a vehicle.)

	Your task is to simulate a portion of the control software for
	the vehicle. The input is a sequence of values for the switches
	and the gear shift, in the following order:
	•	Dashboard switches for left and right sliding door,
	child lock, and master unlock (0 for off or 1 for activated)
	•	Inside and outside handles on the left and right sliding doors (0 or 1)
	• Thegearshiftsetting(oneofPND123R). Atypicalinputwouldbe 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 P.

	Print “left door opens” and/or “right door opens” as appropriate. If neither door opens, print “both doors stay closed”."
	 (See Horstmann p234-235)

	Submit your code AND a sample run of your program showing all possible inputs/outputs
